This project is part of Web Development Hackathon conducted by Bangalore Institute of Technology
in which me and team mate Nimmi have created a Online Code Editor which is capable of executing
and showing syntax highlighting of Java, Cpp and Python programming languages.

→ The technology stack used are HTML, CSS, Javascript.
→ we have used CodeMirror JavaScript library which is collection of separate modules that, 
  together, provide a full-featured text and code editor.
→ we have also used compilex which is a node.js library which is used to build online code 
  compiler/interpreter websites and webservices.
→ please go through the code part to better understand about the approach which
  we used to complete this project.
→ we have also added comments to each of the important code part of the project.
